This includes raising capital (through debt or equity), investing in assets, managing working capital, and distributing profits to shareholders.  Key areas within corporate finance include capital budgeting, working capital management, and dividend policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Public Finance:** This deals with the financial management of government entities, including taxation, government spending, budgeting, and debt management.  It involves analyzing the impact of government policies on the economy and the financial well-being of citizens.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Behavioral Finance:** This field combines finance with psychology to understand how psychological biases and emotions affect financial decision-making.  It explores how investors deviate from rational behavior and the resulting market inefficiencies.\n",

            "* **Financial Markets and Institutions:** This focuses on the structure and function of financial markets (stock markets, bond markets, etc.) and the institutions that operate within them (banks, investment banks, insurance companies, etc.).  It examines how these markets allocate capital and manage risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Investment Management:** This involves managing portfolios of financial assets to achieve specific investment objectives, such as maximizing returns or minimizing risk.

            "* **Time Value of Money:**  The concept that money available at the present time is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity.\n",
            "* **Discounting and Compounding:**  Methods used to calculate the present and future values of money.\n",
            "* **Capital Budgeting:**  The process of evaluating and selecting long-term investments.\n",
